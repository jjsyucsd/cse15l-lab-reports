## Part 1: `ChatServer`

The screenshot below shows the code for my `ChatServer`.

Running the first `/add-message` command:

After running `curl "http://localhost:4000/add-message?s=Welcome%20to%20Lecture&user=Professor"`:
* The method `handleRequest(URI url)` from the `Handler` class is called after making the first `curl` request.
* Argument is a `URI` passed by the `curl` command: `/add-message?s=Welcome%20to%20Lecture&user=Professor`
* Relevant field of the `Handler` class is the string `chatLog`, which is an empty string before the request
* This specific request changes the value of `chatLog` from `“”` to `“Professor: Welcome to Lecture \n”`

Running the second `/add-message` command:

After running `curl "http://localhost:4000/add-message?s=Come%20to%20Office%20Hours%20for%20help&user=TA"`:
* The method `handleRequest(URI url)` from the `Handler` class is called again after making the second `curl` request.
* Argument is a `URI` passed by the `curl` command: `/add-message?s=Come%20to%20Office%20Hours%20for%20help&user=TA`
* Relevant field of the `Handler` class is the string `chatLog`, which is `“Professor: Welcome to Lecture \n”` before the request.
* This specific request changes the value of `chatLog` from `“Professor: Welcome to Lecture \n”` to `"Professor: Welcome to Lecture\nTA: Come to Office Hours for help\n"`

## Part 2: `SSH`

This screenshot shows me running `ls` locally on the command line of my computer with the **absolute path** to the *private* key for my SSH key for logging into `ieng6`.

This screenshot shows me running `ls` remotely on the command line of the `ieng6` machine with the **absolute path** to the *public* key for my SSH key for logging into `ieng6`.

This screenshot shows a terminal interaction where I logged into my `ieng6` account without being prompted for a password.

## Part 3: What I Learned

The two most significant things I have learned from lab in week 2 and 3 that I didn't know prior are how to use the `curl` command and how to `SSH` remotely to `ieng6`. Knowing the `curl` command allows me to interact with web servers directly through the command line without having to use the browser (as demonstrated in Skill Demo 1). Learning to use `SSH` for remote access allows me to access my `ieng6` machine and related files from a separate location, which lets me access the processing power of my `ieng6` machine even if the laptop I am using remotely is underpowered.
