# Lab Report 1

In Week 1 lab, we covered three basic filesystem commands: 
* cd
* ls
* cat

## Command 1: cd
The command `cd` stands for change directory. It is used to change the current working directory. Using the `cd` command with no arguments takes you to your home directory. Using the command with a path to a directory as an argument will move the curent working directory into the specified directory. Using the command with a path to a file as an argument will result in an error.

The command `ls`
