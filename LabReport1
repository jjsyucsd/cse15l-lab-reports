# Lab Report 1

In Week 1 lab, we covered three basic filesystem commands: 
* cd
* ls
* cat

## Command 1: cd
The command `cd` stands for change directory. It is used to change the current working directory. Using the `cd` command with no arguments takes you to your home directory. Using the command with a path to a directory as an argument will move the curent working directory into the specified directory. Using the command with a path to a file as an argument will result in an error.

## Command 2: ls
The command `ls` stands for list. It is used to list the contents of a directory. Using the `ls` command with no arguments will list the contents in the current working directory. Using the `ls` command with a path to a directory as an argument will list the contents of the specified directory. Using the command with a path to a file as an argument will result in listing information regarding the specified file.
