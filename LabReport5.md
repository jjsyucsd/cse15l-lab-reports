# Lab Report 5 - Putting it All Together 
---
## Part 1 - Debugging Scenario

This portion of the lab report is written as a conversation on Piazza containing:

1) The original post from a student with a screenshot showing a symptom and a description of a guess at the bug/some sense of what the failure-inducing input is.

2) A response from a TA asking a leading question or suggesting a command to try.

3) Another screenshot/terminal output showing what information the student got from trying that, and a clear description of what the bug is.

4) At the end, all the information needed about the setup including:
- The file & directory structure needed
- The contents of each file before fixing the bug
- The full command line (or lines) you ran to trigger the bug
- A description of what to edit to fix the bug
