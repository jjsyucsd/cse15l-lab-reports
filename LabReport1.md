UCSD CSE15L Spring 2024 - Week 1
# Lab Report 1

In Week 1 lab, we covered three basic filesystem commands: 
* `cd`
* `ls`
* `cat`

## Command 1: `cd`

The command `cd` stands for change directory. It is used to change the current working directory. Using the `cd` command with no arguments takes you to your home directory. Using the command with a path to a directory as an argument will move the curent working directory into the specified directory. Using the command with a path to a file as an argument will result in an error. 

Example 1: Using the `cd` command with no arguments

Example 2: Using the `cd` command with a path to a directory

Example 3: Using the `cd` command with a path to a file

## Command 2: `ls`

The command `ls` stands for list. It is used to list the contents of a directory. Using the `ls` command with no arguments will list the contents in the current working directory. Using the command with a path to a directory as an argument will list the contents of the specified directory. Using the command with a path to a file as an argument will result in listing information regarding the specified file.

Example 1: Using the `ls` command with no arguments

Example 2: Using the `ls` command with a path to a directory

Example 3: Using the `ls` command with a path to a file

## Command 3: `cat`

The command `cat` stands for concatenate. It is used to display the contents of files in the terminal by reading and printing file contents. Using the command with no arguments allows the user to type what text they would like to print to terminal. Using the command with a path to a directory as an argument will result in an error. Using the command with a path to a file will display the contents of the specified file in the terminal.

Example 1: Using the `cat` command with no arguments

Example 2: Using the `cat` command with a path to a directory

Example 3: Using the `cat` command with a path to a file
